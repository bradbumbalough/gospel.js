# Gospel.js

As a developer, I often picture things in life as code. The abstraction and representation of truths in methods and variables helps to understand relationships, cause / affect, and outcomes.

The most important truth I've discovered is that of the Gospel of Jesus Christ -- namely, that I cannot do enough good things to earn any kind of salvation, and instead, Christ took my sin upon himself personally and in turn gives me his own righteousness. 

I've wanted to turn these truths into a coded example for a long time, but this will be a WIP and not be just limited to the gospel.
